# INVISIBLE ARMOR PLUGIN CONFIGURATION FILE

# show your skin proudly to everyone, without losing armor benefits
# is a shame that while there are tons of cool skins you cant show it because of the armor
# 
# formerly "ShowSkin", this is not really an "invisible armor" plugin,
# but a "hide armor while no damaged" plugin
# 
# i decided to make it because i saw some plugins that reach similar goals
# trough protocollib, but the downside is as it does work over the network
# you always see your armor locally and dont really know if other sees or not
# 
# i used to use "armorhider" plugin, but i noted now is useless because damage reductions
# (armor, enchantments, etc.) are calculated BEFORE damage event occurs,
# so even though your armor were timely equipped you will get full damage


# TEMPORARY CHESTS LOCATION

# hidden armors are stored in hidden chests located according world border
# DO NOT EDIT THIS LOCATION ONCE PLAYERS USED THE PLUGIN OR COULD CAUSE ITEMS LOSS

  world: world_the_end
